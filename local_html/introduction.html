<ul>
	<li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was born in Pinehurst, NC but, lived in Candor, NC (near Biscoe, NC) for a while, and then grew up and continue to live in Gastonia, NC. My family is from Honduras which is in Central America. I am a middle child therefore, the most stressed and yet the best.</li>
	<li><strong>Professional/Academic Background:</strong> Going towards a degree in the Information Technology/Business field, I currently work at the ITS Help Desk at Central Campus as a part-time employee. I also work at the Charlotte Observer in uptown revising advertisements that run and print on Sundays and Mondays. I've been at both jobs at relatively the same amount  of time; nearly 8-9 months now. Both jobs consist of using different systems on a daily basis and running into issues that I need to know how to resolve in order to better assist a client or be able to do my job.</li>
	<li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> I am quite advanced with Windows 7 and 10 since I work with them on a daily basis and am always learning something new but, I feel like I know a Macbook/iMac more since I own a Macbook Pro and continuously try to dissect it's use in order to better understand it.</li>
	<li><strong>Courses I'm Taking, and Why: </strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>PSY 150 80</strong> - General Psychology: I tend to think a lot and let myself hear out other's thought but, I want to understand why we think the way we do.</li>
	<li><strong>WEB 110 85</strong> - Internet/Web Fundamentals: I really enjoy coding and the last coding class I took, in regards to web pages, was over a year ago and I absolutely loved it. So, I am very excited, hopefully, to begin coding in this class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Something to Remember Me By:</strong> In other classes I've always been remembered for the guy that works in the ITS Help Desk and at the Charlotte Observer. Unfortunately, I do not make six figures yet.</li>
<li><strong>I'd Also Like to Share:</strong> I enjoy listening to music from across the world; different languages and sounds/instruments. It's a quite beautiful experience not knowing what you're listening to but you feel something you cannot explain.</li>
</ul>
